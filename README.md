# Spatial Processes in HYdrology (SPHY) model
<i>Version 3.0</i>

The Spatial Processes in Hydrology (SPHY) model is a hydrological modeling tool suitable for a wide range of water resource management applications. SPHY is a state-of-the-art, easy to use, robust tool, that can be applied for operational as well as strategic decision support. The SPHY model has been applied and tested in various studies ranging from real-time soil moisture predictions in flat lands, to operational reservoir inflow forecasting applications in mountainous catchments, irrigation scenarios in the Nile Basin, and detailed climate change impact studies in the snow- and glacier-melt dominated the Himalayan region.

With respect to version 2.2, the code in version 3.0 has been restructured, and modules for erosion have been added.

<b>Acknowledgements</b></br>
The development and publication of the SPHY model source code, its binaries, GUIs, and case-studies has been supported through various (research) projects that were partly or completely funded by the following organizations:
<ul>
<li>International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD)</li>
<li>European Space Agency (ESA)</li>
<li>Asian Development Bank  (ADB)</li>
<li>World Bank</li>
<li>Rijksdienst voor Ondernemend Nederland (RVO)</li>
<li>NUFFIC</li>
</ul>
We are very grateful to these organizations that made the development of the SPHY model possible. 
We hope to continue to collaborate with these organizations in the future in order to further develop and improve the SPHY model and its interfaces.
